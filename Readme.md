This repo contains the solutions to the DevelopIntelligence
developer challenge.  Several variations of the solutions are
presented.  There are Unit tests in the test folders.

There are also a bunch of JMH benchmarks in WordBenchMark.
Easy to run.  And informative. And fun.  Try setting up a benchmark
for your implementation.
